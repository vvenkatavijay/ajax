This repository is my experiments with Ajax. I see ajax everywhere and I decided that I need some of that action too. 

Ajax is a powerful JQuery tool (atleast what I used) that makes remote HTTP calls and refreshes your webpage without refreshing. 

Each folder in this repository represents is an experiment on AJAX. The Notes, Post and Task folders use the CodeIgniter framework to create a simple app and I added AJAX on top of it to make it cooler!
